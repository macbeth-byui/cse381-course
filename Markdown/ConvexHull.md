## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the ConvexHull.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain how the points are sorted in the Convex Hull (Graham Scan) algorithm.

2. Explain how the algorithm can determine if three points form a convex, concave, or co-linear angle.

3. Explain how the algorithm selects the correct points for inclusion in the hull.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for generating the convex hull (where $n$ is the number points):

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore a different algorithm called Jarvis March and describe how it works and compares with Graham Scan.
