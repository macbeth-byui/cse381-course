(c) BYU-Idaho - It is an honor code violation to post this file completed in a public file sharing site. S4.

Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the DAGShortestPath.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain how the verticies in a DAG are topologically sorted.

2. Explain why we need to topologically sort the vertices to find the shortest path in a DAG.

3. Explain how the algorithm finds the shortest distance to a vertex as it loops through each of the verticies in the toplogically sorted vertex list.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the shortest path (where $V$ is the number of verticies in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges):

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore the use of the DAG data structure used in the Git version control softare.
