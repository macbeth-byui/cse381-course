(c) BYU-Idaho - It is an honor code violation to post this file completed in a public file sharing site. S4.

Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the DijkstraShortestPath.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain why Dijkstra relaxes the edges of verticies with the currently smallest calculated shortest path distance first.

2. Explain the process of relaxing the edges adjacent to a vertex.

3. Explain how the Priority Queue works and how it can be used with Dijkstra.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the shortest path (where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges):

* Using an Array:
    * Worst Case: $O()$
    * Best Case: $\Omega())$

* Using a Priority Queue:
    * Worst Case: $O()$
    * Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore the use of the use of the A* algorithm to find the shortest path with road maps and compare it with Dijkstra.
