## Instructions

Part of the Final Exam is a multiple choice quiz.  Some of the questions on the exam will relate to performance analysis.  The exam is open-note which means that this study guide can be used during the exam.  Your are **strongly** encouraged to fill this out during the semester as we discuss performance in class.  You will not submit this document.

Notes:
* ^ - Including the Topo Sort
* ^^ - Excluding FSM generation
* ^^^ - Encoding and Decoding

If Best Case or Average Case is different from Worst Case, then explain why for each algorithm:

## Master Theorem

1. What is the master theorem formula?

2. What are the 3 cases?

* Case 1:

* Case 2:

* Case 3:

3. Use Master Theorem with Binary Search:


4. Use Master Theorem with Merge Sort:


## Graphs - Sparse vs Dense

1. What is the relationship between Edges and Vertices in a Sparse Graph?

2. What is the relationship between Edges and Vertices in a Dense Graph?
