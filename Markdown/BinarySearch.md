Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the BinarySearch.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain the differences between the Binary Search Algorithm and the Linear Search.

2. Explain the base cases in the Binary Search algorithm.

3. Explain the recursive cases in the algorithm.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the search (where $n$ is the number of items in the list):

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore the differences between recursive and non-recursive implementations of Binary Search.  Describe what you learned.
