## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the MergeSort.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain the base cases in the Merge Sort algorithm.

2. Explain the recursive cases in the algorithm.

3. Explain how the algorithm merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance of the sort (where $n$ is the number of items in the list):

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore how Bottom-Up MergeSort works and how it compares with Top-Down MergeSort (which is the version we have been using).
