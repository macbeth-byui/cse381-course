Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the BellmanFord.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain why the Bellman Ford algorithm attempts to relax all the edges V-1 times (where V is the number of verticies).

2. Explain how this algorithm is a better choice for graphs with negative weights as compared with Dijkstra.

3. Explain how this algorithm can detect a negative cycle.  Can the algorithm detect a positive cycle?

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the shortest path (where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges):

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore the different ways that searching for negative cycles with Bellman Ford is useful.
