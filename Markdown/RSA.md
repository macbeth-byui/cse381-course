Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the RSA.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain the process for calculating the public keys in RSA.

2. Explain the process for calculating the private key in RSA.

3. Explain the process for calculating a^b mod N using recursion.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the modular exponentiation (where $n$ is the exponent value)

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and compare it with RSA.
