Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the StringMatcher.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain the process for determining the next state in the Finite State Machine if the next value received matches the next value in the pattern.

2. Explain the process for determining the next state in the Finite State Machine if the next value received does not match the next value in the pattern.

3. Explain how the generated FSM table is used to search for matches of a pattern in a line of text.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance of the matching assuming the finite state machine table is already built (where $n$ is the length of the text being checked)

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore how KMP is used in bio-informatics.
