# Huffman Tree - Algorithm Report

(c) BYU-Idaho - It is an honor code violation to post this file completed in a public file sharing site. S4.

Name: 

## 1. Code (60%)

Make sure that you submit both the HuffmanTree.cs file and this markdown file.

## 2. Methodology (20%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from an AI or the book.  Answer these questions in your own words without code.  You will either receive a grade of `Correct`, `More Detail Needed`, or `Incorrect` for each question.

1. Explain how text is profiled prior to creating huffman codes.

2. Explain how huffman codes are created from the profile by using a priority queue to build a huffman tree.

3. Explain how to decode a string of huffman codes (1's and 0's) using the huffman tree.

## 3. Performance (10%)

The performance for the encode and decode (where $n$ is the length of text to encode or decode)

* Encode:
    * Worst Case: $O()$
    * Best Case: $\Omega()$
* Decode:
    * Worst Case: $O()$
    * Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 4. AI Research (10%)

NOTE: Do not copy/paste from the AI.  Describe what you learned in at least 100 of your own words.

Using an AI, explore Adaptive Huffman Coding which can create encode data without creating a profile first.
